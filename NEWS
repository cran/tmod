Version 0.28:
  * Apparently, knitr cache got packed in the package itself, blowing up
    its size ten fold.

Version 0.29:
  * A last minute bugfix

Version 0.28:
  * Added simpleBoxpie - rectangular plots that are thought better to
    visualize areas than regular pie charts
  * added a few palette functions from my personal repertoire


Version 0.27:
  * Introduced metabolic modules and created a vignette section for a case
    study in metabolomic
  * changed the return object of tmodPCA()
  * added the "extra" parameter to showModule(); showModule() can take a
    data frame or a vector now
  * added "row.labels.style" parameter to tmodPanelPlot()


Version 0.25:
  * corrected the malfunctioning testthat test. I HATE TESTTHAT. (Also, I
    read it as "test t hat" - and wonder about estimates and Student's t)


Version 0.24:
  * msigDB is broken, it no longer has unique identifiers in the global XML
    file. I corrected the import function to make sure identifiers are
    unique.
  * pvalEffectPlot was expecting log10(p-values) rather than p-values. This
    has been taken care of.
  * evidencePlot can now generate GSEA-style curves (with the "style"
    option)


Version 0.22:

  * added Cohen's d estimate and t statistic to tmodLimmaTopTable()
  * rewrote evidencePlot: it is now much more flexible
